# FileManagement

Community problems:
During our interview with the Brgy. Chairwoman, the following issues arise:

* Brgy Data System is currently in process.
* Different Brgy officials are in charge of Brgy files and documents.
* The manual or traditional method of filing records is used.
* Some documents are kept and recorded in a logbook (such as blotter documents)
* Handwritten data is always used to collect information from Brgy residents.

As per Brgy II. Chairwoman, they needed a Branggay Management System for accurate filing and record-keeping, as well as for faster and easier processing of every transaction that occurred in the Brgy II Baranggay Hall.

# The solution to the problem of the Brgy II
An organization's core record-keeping mechanism is this filing system. The Brgy II will be more organized, systematic, and efficient as a result of this. It also makes it easier for anyone who needs access to information to do so.

Filing entails storing records in a secure location and being able to locate them quickly and easily. Documents that have been well-cared for are less likely to tear, become misplaced, or become dirty.
